## Description
-This is a full featured tech blog. it allows multiple users to sign up and post tech related posts. It's a great space to share opinions about tech in a simple space where your ideas come first. In addidtion you can also submit comments to start a conversation under another post.

### Project Motivation:
- I was motivated to create this project to solidify my full-stack node.js/sequelise knowlege. I feel that this type of project is one I will be building quite frequently so the practice was very useful.

### Project Problem solved:
- This project creates a space to share and converse about tech in a small-scale setting. gone are the algorithms and sponsered posts of facebook, twitter, or reddit. Simply a gathering space to talk about tech.

### Skills Learned during project:
- I learned better how to create a full stack web application quickly! I feel that I will be easier able to replicate the basic structure so I can focus on the functionality of the application
